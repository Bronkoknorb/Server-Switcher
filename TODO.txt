* Server switcher options/settings in Tools menu (DONE in not released version, see old/new_not-released, TODO: icon)
* Reload icon when option dialog is closed, so that the current tab does not have to be reopened
* Key combo using Key-Element (will then be shown in the menu correctly)
* switching using wildcards, e.g. *.local => *.com (difficult)
* switching should be independent of leading "www."
* "*://" protocol, so that only one project for http and https servers needed (but where to switch?)
* Compatibility with Mozilla Archive Format Extension
* Switching between more than two servers (e.g. staging server)
* Sub menu that allows switching in Tools menu
* The same sub menu also opens if you right click the icon (shows all servers, active marked (radio-menu), default bold)
* Show state (dev,live) in the icon of tabs (favicon) (small sub-icon in corner)
